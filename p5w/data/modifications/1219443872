== What is Perl? ==

Perl is a dynamic programming language with tendencies towards expressivity rather than minimalism. One of its central tenets being that \'\'There Is More Than One Way To Do It\'\', Perl accomodates a many-cultured assortment of solutions to common programming problems. Through various fora, a well-written core documentation, and a central repository of thousands of modules, Perl culture is constantly being passed on and added to.

== What is Perl 6? ==

\'\'"Perl 6 is the community\'s rewrite of Perl, and the community\'s rewrite of the community." -- Larry Wall\'\'

Since the year 2000, Perl 6 has been in the making. The process of arriving at a full implementation of the language has taken a long time; not least because the Parrot virtual machine and its assorted toolchain needed to be built to host the language. Even the design process itself has evolved and matured during this time. Perl 6 is a fresh redesign of Perl, throwing away unfortunate design elements that have accumulated -- not only in Perl, but in the language design field in general -- while keeping the good parts and throwing in some new gems as well.

\'\'"Perl 6 is second system syndrome done right." -- Larry Wall\'\'

== Why use Perl 6? ==

People who have experience with Perl 5 might ask themselves what they have to gain from using Perl 6. Here\'s what we believe are the advantages:

* At the early stages of development, Perl 6 allows for rapid prototyping and fluent experimentation.
* As the application matures, the OO techniques built into Perl 6 help to organize things into component parts, with much flexibility (using classes, subtypes, roles, traits and multimethod dispatch).
* When the problem domain becomes clearer, the presence of clean macros and user-defined operators help in specializing Perl 6 for the task at hand.
* Somewhat less radically, but at least as powerful, the built-in grammar support allows you to specify domain-specific languages, with parsing and abstract syntax trees included in the deal.
* CPAN is still there, so the power of Perl 5 can be leveraged in Perl 6 as well. While backwards-incompatible, Perl 6 can still talk to Perl 5 (and many other languages) through the Parrot platform.

== Why write a wiki? ==

The wiki stands as one of the cornerstones in the Web 2.0 paradigm &mdash; a web site that users can contribute to without themselves being owners. There are hundreds of wiki engines out there, in various stages of embracing the "wiki philosophy", and written in many different languages. We believe that Perl 6 is especially well suited for implementing a wiki engine, not only for the above reasons, but also because the adaptability of Perl 6 goes well with the mutating requirements of a wiki platform. It will be interesting to see how far Perl 6 can take the wiki idea.

As one of the first large-scale applications written in Perl 6, it is also a nice show-case of what Perl 6 on Parrot can do today.',
