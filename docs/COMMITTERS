Hello, committer. Glad you're here. In case you haven't seen
http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/37340 yet, here's the informative part
reproduced:

== 5 things you might be helped by if you plan to hack on November ==

1. First, feel free to ignore these rules if they inconvenience you. They are
there to help you, not to restrict you.

2. The three files FEATURES, JANITORS and LOOKINTO in the docs/ directory
constitute our roadmap right now.

3. As a rule, we implement feature-size things in p5w before we try them out on
p6w. This is because bugs easily distract from the goal in p6w. The Perl 5
version is a sort of live spec for the Perl 6 version.

4. We're currently doing quite a bit of our work in branches. Currently, there
are two branches: new-html-template aims to replace the HTML::Template with a
new grammar-using module, and tests is a playground for new test files for
other modules. (Things like branches change quickly. github is the ultimate
reference.)

5. Patches are very welcome, nowadays through the mailing list
november-wiki@googlegroups.com, or the IRC channel #november over at
irc.freenode.org.

There's also an emerging coding standard, starting with the message
http://groups.google.com/group/november-wiki/msg/1f168acfb2049830 on
the november-wiki mailing list:

* All module files start with the line "use v6" and end with an empty
line followed by "# vim:ft=perl6".

* No "#!perl6" shebang line is needed in the module files.

* No copyright statements, no authorship statements, no version
numbers. We keep the copyright statement in Test.pm out of courtesy -- and
likely for legal reasons, too.

* People are encouraged to add themselves to the AUTHORS file, even
before committing anything else.
