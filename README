CONTRIBUTING

We'll hand out commit bits liberally. If you want to contribute, create an
account on github.org and send your github handle to Johan
(johan.viklund@gmail.com).  Patches are ok too, if you prefer those.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You need Parrot and Rakudo. Check it out from the Parrot svn repository and
follow instructions there. See instructions on the parrot site:

 <http://www.parrotcode.org/>

RUNNING NOVEMBER
----------------

* From the command line
  
  Set the PARROT_PATH variable to the path of your parrot directory.

  This will generate the Main_Page on STDOUT:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh

  To specify which page to view you need to specify the get paramters on the
  command line like this:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh 'action=view&page=Main_Page'

  You can actually skip the 'action=view' part since viewing is the default
  action.

  The other actions we have so far are edit, log_in and log_out. 

* On a web server

  We have only tested it on Apache. You need to put these files and
  directories in the cgi-bin directory of apache:

    wiki.sh
    wiki
    skin/
    HTML
    CGI.pm
    Impatience.pm
    data/

  And make sure that the files and directories below data are readable and
  writable by the webbserver. Also, if you want a pretty wiki you need to copy
  these files into the root of your web server
  
    skin/spartan.css
    skin/november-logo.png

  Seriously. (This will change, though.)

  Edit the file wiki.sh and update the PARROT_PATH variable.

  After this, you can direct your browser to the wiki. The URL will
  look something like this:

    http://localhost/cgi-bin/wiki.sh
