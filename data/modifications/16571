["FAQ", "''Larry Wall: You should not take this picture to mean that linguistics is the opposite of common sense. But ehm, there are many computer scientists, who have complained that it should be more like engineering and less like an art. And I disagree. But that's okay.''\n\n== Excerpt from the ''Language Design'' Tablet ==\n\nThe complete text can be found at [http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_language_design_tablet].\n\n== Main Goal ==\n\nEnjoy Life and enjoy the freedom of expressing yourself. Which means: support you as much as possible and not to force you in any way. Perl 6 likes to be even better than Perl 5, your humble servant for translating your thoughts into binary code (if possible).\n\n== Strategy ==\n\nEvery style and level of expertise has to be supported and even more difficult: all of them have to play together well. The default often imitates a natural language (i.e. english). Strategies and concepts for this are coined in several often repeated terms.\n\n\n", "someone", "basic FAQ page so there's something to look at", 1310165701]
