ABSTRACT

This file describes the structure of the repository and instructions on how to
run the wiki, both from the command line and on a webbserver.

CONTRIBUTE
----------

We will be liberal commiter bits. If you want to contribute, create an account
on github.org and send your github handle to Johan (johan.viklund@gmail.com).
Of course, if you don't want to commit directly, we will accept patches as
well.

You need Parrot and Rakudo. Check it out from the Parrot svn repository and
follow instructions there. See instructions on the parrot site:

RUNNING PERL 6 NOVEMBER
-----------------------

* From the command line
  
  First set the PARROT_PATH variable to the path of your parrot directory.

  This will generate the Main_Page on STDOUT:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh

  To specify which page to view you need to specify the get paramters on the
  command line like this:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh 'action=view&page=Main_Page'

  You can actually skip the 'action=view' part since viewing is the default
  action.

  The other actions we have so far are edit, log_in and log_out. 

* On a webbserver

  We have only tested it on Apache. You need to put these files and
  directories in the cgi-bin directory of apache:

    wiki.sh
    wiki
    skin/
    HTML
    CGI.pm
    Impatience.pm
    data/

  And make sure that the files and directories below data are readable and
  writable by the webbserver. Also, if you want a pretty wiki you need to copy
  these files into the root of your webbserver
  
    skin/spartan.css
    skin/november-logo.png

  No, we are not kidding, this will change though.

  Edit the file wiki.sh and update the PARROT_PATH variable.

  After this, you can direct your browser to the wiki, probably the URL will
  be something on the lines of:

    http://localhost/cgi-bin/wiki.sh
