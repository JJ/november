-------------------

November is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
terms of the Artistic License 2.0.  (Note that, unlike the Artistic License
1.0, version 2.0 is GPL compatible by itself, hence there is no benefit to
having an Artistic 2.0 / GPL disjunction.)

CONTRIBUTING
------------

We'll hand out commit bits liberally. If you want to contribute, create an
account on github.org and send your github handle to Johan
(johan.viklund@gmail.com).  Patches are ok too, if you prefer those.  See
docs/COMMITTERS if these thoughts intrigue you.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You need Parrot and Rakudo. Check it out from the Parrot svn repository and
follow instructions there. See instructions on the parrot site:

 <http://www.parrotcode.org/>

REPOSITORY LAYOUT
-----------------

/
│
├─p6w/    Perl 6 wiki implementation
│
└─p5w/    Perl 5 reference implementation

RUNNING NOVEMBER
----------------

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make # not required, only for speed

* From the command line
  
  This will generate the Main_Page on STDOUT:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh

  To specify which page to view you need to specify the GET paramters on the
  command line, as follows:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh 'action=view&page=Main_Page'

  You can actually skip the 'action=view' part since viewing is the default
  action.

  The other actions we have so far are edit, log_in, log_out and
  recent_changes. 

* On a web server

  We have only tested it on Apache. You need to put these files and
  directories in the cgi-bin directory of apache:

    wiki.sh
    wiki
    skin/
    HTML/
    CGI.pm
    Impatience.pm
    Wiki.pm
    data/

  If you have compiled november you can copy the .pir files instead of the .pm
  files. And make sure that the files and directories below data/ are readable
  and writable by the webbserver. Also, if you want a styled wiki you need to
  copy the following files into the root of your web server:
  
    skin/spartan.css
    skin/november-logo.png

  Seriously. (This will change, though.)

  After this, you can direct your browser to the wiki. The URL will
  look something like this:

    http://localhost/cgi-bin/wiki.sh
