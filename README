-------------------

November is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the

1.0, version 2.0 is GPL compatible by itself, hence there is no benefit to

CONTRIBUTING
------------

We'll hand out commit bits liberally. If you want to contribute, create an
account on github.org and send your github handle to Johan
(johan.viklund@gmail.com).  Patches are ok too, if you prefer those.  See
docs/COMMITTERS if these thoughts intrigue you.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You need Parrot and Rakudo. Check it out from the Parrot svn repository and
follow instructions there. See instructions on the parrot site:

RUNNING NOVEMBER
----------------

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make # not required, and doesn't currently work

* Running November on the command line
  
  This will generate the Main_Page on STDOUT:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh

  To specify which page to view you need to specify the GET paramters on the
  command line, as follows:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh
    $ ./test_wiki.sh 'action=view&page=Main_Page'

  The above two commands are equivalent, since 'view' is the default action,
  and 'Main_Page' is the default page for the 'view' action.

  The other actions we have so far are 'edit', 'log_in', 'log_out' and
  'recent_changes'.

* Running November through a web server

  We have only tested the following on the Apache web server. You need to put
  these files and directories in the 'cgi-bin' directory of Apache:

    wiki.sh
    wiki
    skin/
    HTML/
    CGI.pm
    Impatience.pm
    Wiki.pm
    data/

  If you have compiled November you can copy the .pir files instead of the .pm
  files. Make sure that the files and directories below data/ are readable
  and writable by the web server. Also, if you want a styled wiki you need to
  copy the following files into the root of your web server:
  
    skin/spartan.css
    skin/november-logo.png

  Seriously. (This will change, though.)

  After this, you can direct your browser to the wiki. The URL will
  look something like this:

    http://localhost/cgi-bin/wiki.sh
