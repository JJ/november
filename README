LICENSE INFORMATION
-------------------

November is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
terms of the Artistic License 2.0.  (Note that, unlike the Artistic License
1.0, version 2.0 is GPL compatible by itself, hence there is no benefit to

CONTRIBUTING
------------

We'll hand out commit bits liberally. If you want to contribute, create an
account on github.org and send your github handle to Johan
(johan.viklund@gmail.com).  Patches are ok too, if you prefer those.  See
docs/COMMITTERS if these thoughts intrigue you.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You'll need Parrot and Rakudo. Check them out from the Parrot svn repository
and follow the instructions in the checkout. Note that the latest 'stable
release' of Parrot/Rakudo often isn't new enough, since we tend to use features
developed after the latest release.

See instructions on the parrot site:

RUNNING NOVEMBER
----------------

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make             # not required; speeds up startup times
 $ make test        # not required; requires Test::Harness v3.00 or higher

* Running November on the command line
  
  This will generate the Main_Page on STDOUT:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh

  To specify which page to view you need to specify the path, as follows:

    $ ./test_wiki.sh
    $ ./test_wiki.sh /view/Another_Page
    $ ./test_wiki.sh /all
    $ ./test_wiki.sh /recent
    $ ./test_wiki.sh /view/Main_Page

  The above first and last commands are equivalent, since 'view' is the 
  default action, and 'Main_Page' is the default page for the 'view' action.

  The other actions we have so far are 'edit', 'log_in', 'log_out'.

* Running November through a web server

  We have only tested the following on the Apache web server. You need to put
  these files and directories in some directory where Apache can execute it
  (your cgi-bin/ dir for example):

    wiki.sh
    wiki
    Config.pm
    CGI.pm
    Dispatcher.pm
    Dispatcher/Rule.pm
    HTML/Template.pm
    HTML/Template/Grammar.pm
    November.pm
    November/Storage.pm
    November/Storage/File.pm
    Session.pm
    Tags.pm
    Text/Escape.pm
    Text/Markup/Wiki/Minimal.pm
    Text/Markup/Wiki/Minimal/Grammar.pm
    Text/Markup/Wiki/MediaWiki.pm
    URI.pm
    URI/Grammar.pm
    Utils.pm

    skin/

  Then put these directories somewhere else. Preferably someplace where apache
  can't serve them over the net. And yes, skin/ should be in both places we're
  working on that.

    data/
    skin/

  Edit the Config.pm file and set the $.server_root variable to the directory
  under which both skin/ and data/ is accessible (remember to include a
  trailing slash). $.web_root has to be '' for the moment, we haven't yet
  implemented the ability to have november anywhere else, but hang in there.

  If you have compiled November you can copy the .pir files instead of the .pm
  files. Make sure that the files and directories below data/ are readable
  and writable by the web server.

  To set up Apache to handle all request by November, you can use mod_rewrite:

    RewriteRule ^/([^\.]*)$ /cgi-bin/wiki.sh [PT]

  If you are using Apache for other purposes as well, you might want to do
  the rewriting differently.

  After this, you can direct your browser to the wiki:

    http://localhost/
