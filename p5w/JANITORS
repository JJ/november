A few things that need to be done, but that are not critical to the success
of the project:

* Hide "Log in" when logged in and "Log out" when logged out.

* Find all messages on the page and replace them with sensible things.

* Rethink the exact layout of the login screen.

* Refine the time indications in recent changes. (Right now they are just
  seconds since epoch.)

* Add 'returnto' links for the login and logout actions. And maybe redirects,
  or at least manual links.

* Cosmetically remove the underscores in link titles.

* Implement 'created new page' flag in recent-changes.

* Implement 'minor edits'.

* Think about the pre- and postconditions of every subroutine. For example,
  read_old_page currently assumes that $revision lies in the right interval
  (1..$latest). Implement checks so that the wiki engine never crashes from
  this kind of user input. Document pre- and postconditions.

* Add a nice little message 'You are viewing an old revision of this page'
  to the view-old-revision pages.

* Add nice little '<- go to previous edition' and 'go to next revision ->'
  to the view-old-revision pages.

* Make the CSS stylesheet adhere to a baseline grid
